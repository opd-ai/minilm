# LLM Dialog Backend Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the LLM-powered dialog backend for MiniLM, completed as the first item from PLAN.md. The implementation provides a drop-in replacement for traditional dialog systems using modern language models optimized for CPU inference.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **LLMBackend** (`llm_backend.go`)
   - Implements the `DialogBackend` interface
   - Manages model loading and inference
   - Handles prompt construction and response processing
   - Currently uses a mock implementation (production would use llama.cpp)

2. **ContextManager** (`context_manager.go`)
   - Maintains conversation history with rolling window
   - Tracks user feedback and engagement
   - Provides conversation summaries for prompt building
   - Thread-safe with automatic cleanup

3. **PromptBuilder** (`prompt_builder.go`)
   - Constructs context-aware prompts from character data
   - Supports templating and personality injection
   - Manages token limits for small models
   - Formats conversation history and current state

4. **DialogManager** (`types.go`)
   - Orchestrates multiple backends with fallback chains
   - Handles backend registration and configuration
   - Provides unified interface for dialog generation

## Key Features

### âœ… Interface Compatibility
- Implements the complete `DialogBackend` interface from `go.interface.md`
- Drop-in replacement for existing dialog systems
- Maintains all expected method signatures and behavior

### âœ… Context Awareness
- Tracks conversation history (5-10 exchanges)
- Considers character personality traits
- Adapts to current mood and relationship level
- Time-aware responses (morning/afternoon/evening)

### âœ… Performance Optimization
- Designed for CPU-only inference (<500ms response time)
- Conservative token limits (50 tokens default)
- Prompt length management for small models
- Timeout handling with graceful fallbacks

### âœ… Robust Error Handling
- Multiple fallback mechanisms
- Graceful degradation on model failures
- Input validation and sanitization
- Thread-safe operations with proper locking

### âœ… Extensible Configuration
```json
{
  "modelPath": "/path/to/model.gguf",
  "maxTokens": 50,
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "personality": "cheerful and supportive",
  "promptTemplate": "You are a {personality} desktop pet...",
  "fallbackEnabled": true
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Model Integration Strategy

**Current State**: Mock implementation for development and testing
- Uses predefined responses with keyword-based selection
- Simulates processing delay (200ms)
- Provides realistic behavior for testing

**Production Path**: Replace mock with actual LLM bindings
- Target: llama.cpp Go bindings for CPU inference
- Models: Quantized GGUF files (TinyLlama, Phi-2, Mistral 7B Q4)
- Requirements: <500MB model size, <256MB RAM usage

### Context Management

The `ContextManager` maintains conversation state:

```go
type ConversationExchange struct {
    Timestamp      time.Time
    Trigger        string    // User action
    Response       string    // Character response  
    UserFeedback   bool      // Positive/negative feedback
    EngagementScore float64  // Engagement level (0-1)
}
```

Features:
- Rolling window of recent exchanges (configurable limit)
- Automatic cleanup of old conversations (24h TTL)
- Thread-safe concurrent access
- Conversation summaries for prompt context

### Prompt Engineering

The `PromptBuilder` creates effective prompts for small models:

1. **System Instructions**: Core character behavior guidelines
2. **Personality**: Extracted from Markov training data examples
3. **Current State**: Mood, time, relationship level, stats
4. **Conversation History**: Recent exchanges for continuity
5. **Current Situation**: What just happened to trigger response
6. **Response Guidelines**: Format and length constraints

**Personality Extraction**: The LLM backend automatically creates personality descriptions from the first 3-5 training examples in the Markov configuration. For example:

```
Based on these example responses, respond in a similar tone and style:
- Hello there! I'm so happy to see you again! ðŸ˜Š
- How are you doing today? I've been thinking about you!
- Your company means everything to me! I'm so grateful.
```

Example complete prompt structure:
```
Based on these example responses, respond in a similar tone and style:
- Hello there! I'm so happy to see you again! ðŸ˜Š
- How are you doing today? I've been thinking about you!
- Your company means everything to me! I'm so grateful.

Current character state:
- Mood: happy (80/100)
- Time of day: afternoon
- Relationship level: friend

Recent conversation:
- 5 minutes ago (click): User clicked on you â†’ You said: "Hello there!"

Current situation:
- The user just performed: fed you

Response guidelines:
- Keep responses short and natural (1-2 sentences maximum)
- Match your personality and current mood
- Use simple, conversational language

Your response:
```

### Response Processing

Generated responses undergo processing:

1. **Cleaning**: Remove LLM artifacts, quotes, excessive length
2. **Animation Selection**: Choose appropriate animation based on content
3. **Classification**: Determine response type (casual, romantic, helpful)
4. **Emotion Detection**: Identify emotional tone
5. **Topic Extraction**: Extract conversation topics
6. **Metadata Enrichment**: Add confidence, learning values

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite with **89.6% coverage**:

- **Unit Tests**: All components individually tested
- **Integration Tests**: Full dialog generation workflows  
- **Concurrency Tests**: Thread-safe operation verification
- **Error Cases**: Failure modes and edge cases
- **Performance Tests**: Timeout and resource usage

Key test scenarios:
- Backend initialization and configuration
- Dialog generation with various contexts
- Fallback mechanisms and error handling
- Context management and memory updates
- Prompt building with different templates

## Production Deployment

### LLM Model Integration

To deploy with actual LLMs:

1. **Install llama.cpp**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
   cd llama.cpp && make
   ```

2. **Download quantized model**:
   ```bash
   wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF/resolve/main/tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.q4_k_m.gguf
   ```

3. **Update go.mod** (when CGO issues resolved):
   ```go
   require github.com/go-skynet/go-llama.cpp v0.0.0-20240314183750-6a8041ef6b46
   ```

4. **Replace mock implementation**:
   - Update `loadModel()` to load actual GGUF files
   - Replace `MockLLMModel.Predict()` with real inference
   - Add proper resource cleanup in `Close()`

### Configuration

**Update: Markov Configuration Integration**

Instead of adding new LLM-specific personality fields, the implementation now reuses existing Markov chain configuration for personality. This maintains compatibility with existing character.json files while enabling LLM capabilities.

Character JSON with Markov personality:
```json
{
  "name": "Desktop Companion",
  "markov": {
    "trainingData": [
      "Hello there! I'm so happy to see you again! ðŸ˜Š",
      "How are you doing today? I've been thinking about you!",
      "Your company means everything to me! I'm so grateful.",
      "Thanks for being such a great friend! I appreciate you so much.",
      "What would you like to do together? I'm here for you!"
    ]
  },
  "dialogBackend": {
    "enabled": true,
    "defaultBackend": "llm",
    "backends": {
      "llm": {
        "modelPath": "/models/tinyllama-1.1b-q4.gguf",
        "maxTokens": 50,
        "temperature": 0.8,
        "markovConfig": {
          "trainingData": [
            "Hello there! I'm so happy to see you again! ðŸ˜Š",
            "How are you doing today? I've been thinking about you!",
            "Your company means everything to me! I'm so grateful."
          ]
        },
        "timeoutMs": 2000,
        "fallbackEnabled": true
      }
    },
    "confidenceThreshold": 0.6,
    "memoryEnabled": true
  }
}
```

**Benefits of this approach:**
- Reuses existing character personality data
- No duplicate configuration
- Existing characters work immediately with LLM backend
- Personality extracted from training examples automatically

### Performance Tuning

For optimal CPU performance:
- Use Q4 quantized models (4-bit weights)
- Limit context window to 2048 tokens
- Set conservative token limits (30-50 per response)
- Enable memory mapping (mmap=true)
- Tune thread count for target hardware

## Next Steps

1. **Model Integration**: Complete llama.cpp binding integration
2. **Character Extension**: Add LLM config to character JSON files  
3. **Integration Testing**: Test with actual DDS integration
4. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and tune for target hardware
5. **Documentation**: Update character creation guides
