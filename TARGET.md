### Creating Custom Characters

1. **Create character directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p assets/characters/mycharacter/animations
   ```

2. **Add GIF animations**:
   - Ensure GIFs have transparency for best results
   - Recommended size: 64x64 to 256x256 pixels
   - Keep file sizes under 1MB each for performance

3. **Create character.json**:
   ```bash

### Design Principles

1. **Library-First**: Use existing solutions instead of custom implementations
2. **Standard Library Preference**: Leverage Go's stdlib (json, image/gif) when possible
3. **Minimal Custom Code**: Write only glue code and business logic
4. **Interface-Based**: Use standard Go patterns for testability
5. **Proper Concurrency**: Mutex protection for all shared state

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
go test ./... -v -cover

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/character -v

# Run with race detection
go test ./... -race

# Generate coverage report
go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Performance Monitoring

The application includes built-in performance monitoring and profiling:

```bash
# Run with memory profiling
go run cmd/companion/main.go -memprofile=mem.prof

# Run with CPU profiling  
go run cmd/companion/main.go -cpuprofile=cpu.prof

# Run with both profiles and debug output
go run cmd/companion/main.go -memprofile=mem.prof -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -debug

# Analyze profiles
go tool pprof mem.prof
go tool pprof cpu.prof
```

**Real-time Monitoring**:
- Memory usage tracking and reporting
- Frame rate monitoring with performance warnings
- Startup time measurement
- Concurrent frame rendering support
- Built-in performance profiling capabilities

## 🔨 Building and Distribution

### Development Builds

```bash
# Local development
go run cmd/companion/main.go

# With custom character
go run cmd/companion/main.go -character path/to/character.json

# With debug logging
go run cmd/companion/main.go -debug
```

### Release Builds

```bash
# Native build for current platform
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o companion cmd/companion/main.go

# Using Makefile
make build  # Creates build/companion
```

> **Note**: Due to Fyne GUI framework limitations, cross-compilation is not supported.  
> Fyne requires platform-specific CGO libraries for graphics drivers.  
> Build on the target platform for proper binary distribution.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"failed to initialize display" (Linux)**:
```bash
# Install required X11 libraries
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

**"character.json not found"**:
- Ensure the character directory contains a valid `character.json` file
- Check file paths are relative to the character.json location
- Verify all referenced GIF files exist

**Poor animation performance**:
- Reduce GIF file sizes (optimize with tools like `gifsicle`)
- Lower GIF frame rates to 10-15 FPS
- Ensure character size is reasonable (64-256 pixels)

**Window not staying on top (Linux)**:
- Some window managers don't support always-on-top hints
- Try different desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
- Check window manager documentation for overlay support

**Game features not working**:
- Ensure you're using the `-game` flag to enable Tamagotchi features
- Use character cards with game features (e.g., `character_with_game_features.json`)
- Check that the character card has `stats`, `interactions`, and `gameRules` sections

**Stats overlay not visible**:
- Ensure both `-game` and `-stats` flags are enabled
- Try pressing the 'S' key to toggle stats overlay
- Verify the character card has valid stats configuration

**Save game not loading**:
- Check permissions on save directory (`~/.local/share/desktop-companion/`)
- Ensure character name matches between save file and character card
- Try starting fresh if save file is corrupted (will auto-regenerate)

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
go run cmd/companion/main.go -debug
```

This provides detailed output about:
- Character card loading and validation
- Animation file processing
- Window creation and positioning
- Performance metrics and memory usage
- Game state updates and stat changes (in game mode)
- Save/load operations and persistence
- Achievement progress and random events (in game mode)

For additional help, see the debug output above or check `AUDIT.md` for known issues and resolutions.

**Minimum System Requirements**:
- 512MB RAM available
- 50MB disk space (100MB recommended with save files)
- OpenGL 2.1 or higher (for hardware acceleration)
- X11 (Linux), Cocoa (macOS), or Win32 (Windows) display server

**Recommended for Game Mode**:
- 1GB RAM for smooth performance
- 100MB disk space for save files and multiple character cards
- SSD storage for faster auto-save operations

**Note**: This application requires GIF animation files to run. See the setup instructions above for details on adding animations. Game features require character cards with `stats`, `interactions`, and `gameRules` configuration sections.
